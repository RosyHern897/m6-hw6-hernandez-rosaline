        <p>Hi! I’m Rosaline Hernandez, a passionate educator, creative thinker, and lifelong learner based in Miami. With over seven years of experience in teaching middle school, I thrive on creating engaging, structured learning environments that meet students where they are. I combine empathy and structure to help young learners succeed, even during the unpredictable middle school years. My curiosity about how people learn and interact with technology has recently led me to expand into the world of UX/UI design. I’ve completed the Google UX Design Certificate and continue exploring design principles that enhance both digital and educational experiences.</p>
        <p>More text here about your background and goals...</p>
        <p>Outside the classroom, I’m a full-time mom of three incredible kids who keep me on my toes, from sports practices to events and everything in between. I’m grateful for my husband, a dedicated math professor with a PhD, whose supportive presence and role modeling make our family stronger. At home, our days are also brightened by Belle, our affectionate French bulldog who never fails to add a little joy and cuddles to the mix. I value balance, creativity, and connection, whether I’m building science lessons, designing a project, or just enjoying quality time with my family. My portfolio reflects not just my technical skills, but also the human-centered approach I bring to everything I do. I’m excited to keep growing as a designer and collaborator, blending my background in education with a strong foundation in UX research and design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s degree in Web Design through the University of Florida’s College of Journalism and Communications. This journey marks an exciting chapter of growth and discovery for me. I’m thrilled to expand my skills in digital design and communication, and I’m deeply motivated to apply what I learn to both my creative projects and future career goals. Every step forward in this program is helping me evolve into a more confident, capable, and inspired designer.
